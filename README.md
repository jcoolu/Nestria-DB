Nestria is a video game I designed while coming up with a topic for my databases project. Some of the key parts of Nestria is, like a video game, it has characters (Knights, Vikings, Creatures), weapons, shields, different sceneries and a soundtrack. This project is Java application created for my Databases class. Java, JavaFX, and SQLite were the main factors in designing this program to allow users to interact with the Nestria Database.
